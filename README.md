# Deep-Trading
This an implementation adapted from Rachnog [Neural networks for algorithmic trading. Part One — Simple time series forecasting](https://medium.com/@alexrachnog/neural-networks-for-algorithmic-trading-part-one-simple-time-series-forecasting-f992daa1045a#.fqbs2mtub) and this [code](https://github.com/Rachnog/Deep-Trading). 
This uses Keras library LSTM module to predict stock return prices form S&P 500 index price movements. You can modify this model to acheive better results.
